# GrapheneOS App Compatibility List

This is a very incomplete list of apps that have been tested on GrapheneOS and what results we get. It will be ever-expanding, so if you find a result that works or doesn't, or disagrees, please contact me and I'll try to fix it.

## Disclaimer
**An app appearing on any of these lists should not be construed as an endorsement or a recommendation of these apps. These apps are all published by third parties unrelated to GrapheneOS, and have differing practices with respect to how they behave and whether or not they are invasive. This list is simply an ongoing effort to enumerate which apps have been tested and found to work or found not to work on GrapheneOS.**

**Nothing on this list should be taken as final.**

## Tiers

I've separated the list into a few tiers for easy reading, and this is what they mean:

* **Gold** - These apps work with no problems at all, as they would be expected to. Gold-tier apps have all the functionality that is desired of them.
* **Silver** - Apps under Silver work with some problems that may be noticeable. For example, they may not display notifications properly until the app is opened, or may have certain functionality that might be hampered, but otherwise can be used. The user experience of Silver apps is hampered noticeably, but the app will still run and do what it is largely supposed to do.
* **Broken** - if an app is labelled "Broken" then it doesn't work at all as intended to. It may crash on launch, refuse to connect, or just flat out refuse to run.
