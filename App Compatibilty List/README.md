# GrapheneOS App Compatibility List

This is a very incomplete list of apps that have been tested on GrapheneOS and what results we get. It will be ever-expanding, so if you find a result that works or doesn't, or disagrees, please contact me and I'll try to fix it.

## Tiers

I've separated the list into a few tiers for easy reading, and this is what they mean:

* **Gold** - These apps work with no problems at all, as they would be expected to. Gold-tier apps have all the functionality that is desired of them.
* **Silver** - Apps under Silver work with some problems that may be noticeable. For example, they may not display notifications properly until the app is opened, or may have certain functionality that might be hampered, but otherwise can be used. The user experience of Silver apps is hampered noticeably when using an app under Silver.
* **Broken** - if an app is labelled "Broken" then it doesn't work at all as intended to. It may crash on launch, refuse to connect, or just flat out refuse to run.
